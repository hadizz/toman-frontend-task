# Payment Application

This project is a React front-end assignment designed to fetch and display payment data from a backend API. The application allows searching, filtering, pagination, and preserves state after reloading the page.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
**NOTE: I've update the backend app alittle bit to hanlde filtering on multiple values.**

To get the backend running:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3. Start the backend server with:
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies by running:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3. Start the frontend application with:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`
